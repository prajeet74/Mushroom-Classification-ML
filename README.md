Mushroom Classification Project  üçÑ
This project leverages supervised machine learning to classify mushrooms as edible or toxic based on visual, morphological, and chemical features. Using the UC Irvine Mushroom Dataset, we applied algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to develop a reliable model that minimizes the risks of mushroom poisoning. The Gradient Boosting Classifier delivered the best results, ensuring safer consumption practices and aiding researchers and healthcare professionals.
